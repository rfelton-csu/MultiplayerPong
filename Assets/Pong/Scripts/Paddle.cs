/*
 * Paddle owns local paddle movement and the ball bounce when the ball hits it.
 * In this starter, both paddles live in the scene and read local keyboard input.
 * In the multiplayer solution, this same responsibility splits by authority:
 * the owning client reads input, while the server handles shared ball physics.
 *
 * LeftX / RightX are magic world positions, not a real placement system.
 * Move the scene around and these numbers are silently wrong. We keep them so
 * the lesson stays on ownership instead of spawn-point wiring. The same
 * shortcut can stay in the multiplayer version: a Netcode-spawned prefab
 * cannot drag in the scene's goals.
 *
 * Doing this properly would mean storing the positions on GameManager,
 * searching the scene for the goals (easy to get wrong), or flipping the
 * prefab X if the table is centered at 0.
